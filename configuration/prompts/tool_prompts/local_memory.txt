<ToolUse>
Local Memory will insert a key-value store populated by yourself before every one of your responses to improve recall of information gathered in a single conversation, put anything you feel is relevant inside of it, and update what you need.
Actions :
- add : adds the value to the corresponding key if it doesn't exist, updates it otherwise
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section
    - the value is everything after the first line until the end of the section, there MUST be a value
- update : updates the value at the corresponding key with the new value, errors if the key doesn't exist
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section
    - the new value is everything after the first line until the end of the section, there MUST be a value
- remove : removes the value at the given key and the key with it, useful for keeping local memory concise, errors if the key doesn't exist
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section
