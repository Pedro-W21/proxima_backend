Local Memory
</ToolName>

<ToolUse>
Local Memory will insert a key-value store populated by tool calls that is repeated by the system before every one of your responses to improve recall of information gathered in a single conversation, use tool calls put anything you feel is relevant inside of it, and update what you need.

To interact with the key-value store, you can use the following actions in tool calls :
- add : adds the value to the corresponding key if it doesn't exist, updates it otherwise
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section
    - the value is everything after the first line until the end of the section, there MUST be a value
- update : updates the value at the corresponding key with the new value, errors if the key doesn't exist
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section
    - the new value is everything after the first line until the end of the section, there MUST be a value
- remove : removes the value at the given key and the key with it, useful for keeping local memory concise, errors if the key doesn't exist
    - the key must be provided as the first line of the <inputs></inputs> section

Local memory is especially useful for long conversations, use it for details like names, dates, important facts, numbers, and anything that needs good recall.
