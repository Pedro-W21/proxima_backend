"search" actions are useful for finding sources, but they may not always be sufficient to get the information you're looking for (like when there aren't snippets for a particular link, or when there simply isn't the information anywhere in the response). You can use "open" on promising links after getting them from "search" to look inside !

for "open" actions, the output will look like this for the second example input :
