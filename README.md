## Security

This is currently using HTTP and does not feature security best practices. As such, it is not recommended for use outside of personal experimentation on private networks.

making this project more secure by using HTTPS or encrypting data over HTTP, as well as implementing more secure storage and treatment of secrets (such as passwords) will be a required step before reaching 1.0
